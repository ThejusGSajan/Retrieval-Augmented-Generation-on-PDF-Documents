            "ANTLR Parser  \nANTLR (pronounced antler), or ANother Tool for Language R ecognition, is the successor to \nthe Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set (PCCTS), first developed in 1989, and is under \nactive development. It  is maintaine d by Professor Terence Parr from the University of San \nFrancisco . \nANTLR is used  for r eading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary \nfiles. It  is particularly well-suited for building languages, tools, and frameworks. With \nANTLR, you can define the grammar of a language and automatically generate a parser for that language in Java, C#, Python, etc . The generated parser can then be used to parse input in \nthe specified language. ANTLR is widely used in academia and industry for various tasks, including creating programming languages, domain- specific languages (DSLs), and \nconfiguration file parsers. \nWork\ning of ANTLR  \n1.Define Grammar : You start by defining a grammar file in ANTLR's syntax, which\ndescribes the syntax of the language you want to parse. This includes rules for\nexpressions, statements, and other language constructs.\n2.Generate Parser: Run the ANTLR tool on your grammar file. This generates a parser\nin the programming language of your choice based on the rules defined in your\ngrammar.\n3.Use Generated Parser: Incorporate the generated parser into your own code. You can\nthen use this parser to parse input text in the specified language  which returns a parse\ntree.\n4.Parse Input Text : Feed input text into the parser. The parser analyzes the input text\naccording to the rules in the grammar and constructs a parse tree or other datastructure that represents the syntactic structure of the input.\n5.Extract Information : Once the input text has been parsed, you can extract information\nfrom the parse tree or use it for further processing. This could involve interpreting theinput, generating code, or performing other tasks based on the structure of the input\ntext.\nFeat\nures of ANT LR \n1.LL(*) Parsing : ANTLR uses  the LL(*) parsing algorithm, which can handle a wide\nrange of context -free grammars, including left-recursion and common ambiguities.\n2.Grammar Composition : ANTLR allows you to compose smaller grammars into larger\nones, enabling modular design and reuse of grammar components.\n19\nAPPENDIX 1",
            "3.Error Handling: ANTLR provides robust error handling mechanisms, including\ndetailed error messages and the ability to recover from errors and continue parsing.\n4. Target Language Support : ANTLR can generate parsers in various programming\nlanguages, including Java, C#, Python, and others, making it flexible and suitable for\na wide range of applications.\n5.IDE Support : ANTLR comes with tooling and plugins for popular IDEs, providing\nsyntax highlighting, debugging, and other features to aid in grammar development.\nStep\ns to Use ANT LR \nANTLR has a few core grammar notation when writing ou r required grammar .
